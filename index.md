I am a first year PhD researcher at Linköping University. My PhD is funded by WASP. My research focuses on point cloud registration for distributed autonomous systems, with an emphasis on learning based methods which remain robust under wireless transmission constraints. I am working towards a joint approach where point cloud transmission is adapted to support accurate registration.

Previously, I was doing the EMJMD PSRS masters that took me from France to Finland to Switzerland and then back to France.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I love music and sports. I am crazy about the game of cricket and playing badminton brings me immense joy. Discovering new music and getting lost in the poetry behind lyrics is my favourite thing to do in my free time. Find more in Misc :)
