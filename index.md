I am a second year master student, specialising in Intelligent Vision and Biometrics. I am interested in working in the field of Computer Vision.

<br />
I fell in love with Computer Science with <a href = "https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/">CS50x</a> and I fell in love with AI because of <a href = "https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/">CS50 AI</a>. I am thankful to these Harvard courses for helping me in discovering my passion.

<br />
I have been working with image datasets, thanks to the specialisation track of my masters. The ability to obtain useful information from images and automate certain tasks is an amazing feat in my opinion.

<br />
I have always loved maths. Though intimidating, I am trying my best to be friends with the maths behind AI. Currently, I am reading the Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow et al, an amazing book if you ask me! Got sidetracked so paused it. Trying to do Nans2Tetris these day.

<br />
Aside from my academic pursuits, I love music and sports. I am crazy about the game of cricket and playing badminton brings me immense joy. Discovering new music and getting lost in the poetry behind lyrics is my favourite thing to do in my free time.
