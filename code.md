Will put them on Github and here soon.

* [**Iro.it - A Manga Panel Colorizer Using Pix2Pix**](https://github.com/Garima-Bazard/Iro_it)<br>
This project demonstrates the use of the Pix2Pix model to colorize black-and-white manga panels. The model is trained using a paired dataset of grayscale and color images. The manga panels from the Manga109 dataset are processed and colorized with TensorFlow, and the results are visualized in real time.
