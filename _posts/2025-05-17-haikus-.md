Ain’t the sky, the trees,<br />
the wind & the bird poop on your<br />
head just nature’s grace.

***

In a veg sandwich<br />
some random vegetables<br />
get sandwiched is all.

***

Meant to be team work..<br />
Then how did I end up doing<br />
all of it alone…

***

When hiking with friends<br />
click some pictures, for you will<br />
cherish them later.

***

On seeing humans,<br />
the zoo animals say, “look..<br />
who’s here to amuse us.”

***

I was busy adjusting<br />
rear view mirror but is was<br />
the dirty rear windshield.

***

Gazing in the pond,<br />
we stood, but swans just had to<br />
spoil our reflection.

***

Sunny days are fiery;<br />
Drink those cold drinks;<br />
While the ice cube clinks.

***

Coming online…<br />
some amiable, some belligerent,<br />
some fun people pop up.

***

The glass gave up<br />
on being a glass after seeing<br />
some silver shine.

***

There’s much to learn,<br />
Will one lifetime be enough?<br />
Of course not! Shame!

***

So much to do but<br />
Here I sit doing nothing.<br />
Panicked! Overwhelmed!

***

Anxious for future;<br />
Sabotaging my present;<br />
Reminiscing past.

***

Wanna be a cloud and<br />
drift around

***

Stood in the queue..<br />
For potatoes but know what.<br />
I got spaghetti..

***

Wanna be a cloud<br />
But not here on earth<br />
On jupiter

***

The sky is weeping.<br />
Cold wind, dry skin, dry lips<br />
no cream, no umbrella.
