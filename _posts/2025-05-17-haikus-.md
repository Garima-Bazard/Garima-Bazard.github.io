Ain’t the sky, the trees,<br />
the wind & the bird poop on your
head just nature’s grace.

***

In a veg sandwich
some random vegetables
get sandwiched is all.

***

Meant to be team work..
Then how did I end up doing
all of it alone…

***

When hiking with friends
click some pictures, for you will
cherish them later.

***

On seeing humans,
the zoo animals say, “look..
who’s here to amuse us.”

***

I was busy adjusting
rear view mirror but is was
the dirty rear windshield.

***

Gazing in the pond,
we stood, but swans just had to
spoil our reflection.

***

Sunny days are fiery;
Drink those cold drinks;
While the ice cube clinks.

***

Coming online…
some amiable, some belligerent,
some fun people pop up.

***

The glass gave up
on being a glass after seeing
some silver shine.

***

There’s much to learn,
Will one lifetime be enough?
Of course not! Shame!

***

So much to do but
Here I sit doing nothing.
Panicked! Overwhelmed!

***

Anxious for future;
Sabotaging my present;
Reminiscing past.

***

Wanna be a cloud and
drift around

***

Stood in the queue..
For potatoes but know what.
I got spaghetti..

***

Wanna be a cloud
But not here on earth
On jupiter

***

The sky is weeping.
Cold wind, dry skin, dry lips
no cream, no umbrella.
